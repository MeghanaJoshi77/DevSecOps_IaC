# DevSecOps_IaC
This project details the development and implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for automated infrastructure deployments in an AWS cloud environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and a DevSecOps approach. 
The pipeline prioritizes security through KICS scanning for misconfiguration detection and centralized vulnerability management with DefectDojo. 
Key objectives include streamlined deployments, enhanced team collaboration, and robust security posture. To facilitate seamless integration with Jenkins, the project utilizes Docker containers for its installation.
